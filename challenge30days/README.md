# 30 days leetcoding challenge

- Start from: April 1st, 2020

### Experience

- 01st: First challenge was done in the easy array collection before, so nothing here.
- 02nd: Next challenge is easy and does't take quite a lot of time from me. I feel positive as archiving small wins. Just invite some friends to join the challenge.
- 03rd: Solved by looping but it took 232 ms. Can be improved by using the divide and conquer approach. (major distribution in the region of 50-70 ms)
- 04th: Quite easy, using Javascript Array.prototype.splice to modify array inplace.
