# 30 days leetcoding challenge

- Start from: April 1st, 2020

### Experience

- 1st: First challenge was done in the easy array collection before, so nothing here.
- 2nd: Next challenge is easy and does't take quite a lot of time from me. I feel positive as archiving small wins. Just invite some friends to join the challenge.
- 3rd: Can be improved by using the divide and conquer approach.
