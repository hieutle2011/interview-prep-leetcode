# 30 days leetcoding challenge

- Start from: April 1st, 2020

### Experience

- 01st: First challenge was done in the easy array collection before, so nothing here.
- 02nd: Next challenge is easy and does't take quite a lot of time from me. I feel positive as archiving small wins. Just invite some friends to join the challenge.
- 03rd: Solved by looping but it took 232 ms. Can be improved by using the divide and conquer approach. (major distribution in the region of 50-70 ms)
- 04th: Quite easy, using Javascript Array.prototype.splice to modify array inplace.
- 05th: Solved before.
- 06th: Anagram is a very interesting subject, i found it quite hard to tackle it, learnt a great deal from google it ^^. Will come back to this later.
- 07th: Store numbers in a hash map with its occurence, then loop the hash map to count the valid numbers.
- 08th: Learn single linked-list, how to find middle node. TODO: try to write test case.
- 09th: Manipulate strings and array.
- 10th: Learn implement Object and methods.
- 11th: Learn binary tree and find its depth and diameter
- 12th: Piece of cake
- 13th: Really challenging, brute force solution is exceed time. I have to look up answer on the internet. Thanks God, i learn more about hash map.
